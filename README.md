# nfds-tutorial
Simple tutorial of technical workflow to study negative frequency dependent selection (NFDS) in the accessory genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Covers the bioinformatic steps to go from shotgun whole genome sequencing raw reads to accessory gene frequencies. The accessory gene frequencies can be used to predict the post-vaccination population structure of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The implementation of this NFDS-based quadratic programming predictive model is also discussed.
